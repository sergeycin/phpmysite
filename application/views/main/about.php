                <h1>About myselfh</h1>
                <p>Let me introduce myself. My name is Artiom Kalilnkin. I am nineteen. I am a student of the Rostov
                    Secondary School. At the moment I am in the tenth grade. As of my traits of character, I am
                    purposeful, easy-going, cheerful and responsive. I love my family and friends and I am always eager
                    to help them and divide their joy and sorrows. But at the same time I am touchy and stubborn. I like
                    to spend much time with my nearest and dearest. I adore outdoor activities, picnics, rafting and
                    travelling. I like to sit by the fire with my friends and enjoy the natural beauty of the world.
                    Besides, I am a very versatile person. I am fond of fashion, photography, music, English and
                    painting. In my free time I can spend hours out in the open air indulging in my hobby. On my way to
                    school I always listen to my favorite songs on my iPod. Twice a week I go to the gym where I
                    practice yoga and ballet. I also like to play volleyball and basketball with my friends As to my appearance, I am quite tall and slim with big blue eyes and plump lips. My hair is curly and
                    brown. I have lightly tanned skin. My friends find me rather attractive. Like most teenagers, I
                    prefer wearing casual clothing, such as jeans, T-shirts and sneakers. I hate high-heeled shoes
                    because they are extremely uncomfortable. I usually feel uneasy when I have to wear them on special
                    occasions.My family is not large. My parents have one more child, besides me. Thus I have got an older sister.
                    Her name is Mary. She is in her late twenties. She works in a bank as a chief accountant. She is
                    married and has a wonderful daughter named Alice. I like to play with her. She is very funny and
                    smart. Sometimes I pick her from the nursery school and we walk in the park. I have the best parents in the world. Both of them are understanding, kind and patient. They always
                    support me and give me sound advice. My
                    mother and I are very much alike. She is very beautiful and elegant and always inspires me. My dad
                    is a surgeon. Every day he saves lives of many people. I am happy to have such a friendly family. On
                    our weekends we often go to the country and stay with my grandparents. I help my
                    grandma with gardening or go fishing with my granddad. My grandparents are retired but work
                    part-time as teachers at school. We love to make up picnics. My father usually cooks shish kebab and
                    grilled vegetables. We often sit up late at night and look through our family albums. I can sit for
                    hours studying cach image and recalling life events. It is so touching.In the conclusion, I would like to quote Thomas Jefferson who once said, “The happiest moments of my
                    life have been the few which I have passed
                    at home in the bosom of my family.” I absolutely agree with this statement. As far as I am
                    concerned, I also appreciate every minute of my life spent in the circle of my family.</p>
